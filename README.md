# App for Form/Data Entry for Norm Hendricksen

NB: I had to freeze the pip package django-jsignature manually and patch/replace the library's jSignature.min.js with an updated version from the jSignature JavaScript library on local and form.hendricksenphd.com. The PyPi django-jsignature package is not often or well maintained, and I already tried a PR for an upstream patch.
